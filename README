rcom is a small tool which captures serial dumps.

Compiled and tested under unix.

How to use:

Well, for capturing my null modem serial I use:

rcom -l -s 115200 /dev/ttyS0

Since version 1.2, 'tip' users can also use:

rcom -l ttya115200

Typing 'rcom' without arguments will print the
options.

Contact David Gerber <dg-rcom@zapek.com> for requests but we
don't really plan to develop it any further.
